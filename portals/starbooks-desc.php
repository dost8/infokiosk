Not many people realize that we live and breath science and technology everyday---it is in the things we encounter day by day, it is in us. <b>The Science and Technology Information Institute (STII)</b> of the <b>Department of Science and Technology</b> is mandated by virtue of Executive Order 128 and technology information in the country and accomplishes this by maintaining a physical library and producing multi-media promotions (print and video).</p>
