The increase in weight of the filter represents the total suspended solids. If the suspended material clogs the filter and prolongs filtration, it may be necessary to increase the diameter of the filter and prolongs filtration, it may be necesary to increase the diameter of the filter or decrease the sample volume. To obtain an estimate of total suspended solids, calculate the differnce between total dissolved solids and total solids.',

    4 : 'The pour plate method is simple to perform and can accommodate volumes of sample or diluted sample ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mL. The colonies produced are relatively small and compact, showing the less tendency to encroach on each other than those produced by surface growth. On the other hand, sub-merged colonies often are slower growing, are difficult to transfer, and are not described in published studies. A thermostatically controlled water bath is essential for tempering the agar, but even so, significant heat shock from the transient exposure of the sample to 45 to 46°C agar my occur.',
